# Object-Detection-using-Tensorflow

### Built an object detection model using tensorflow to detect objects in images from the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset.
### I chose to implement the YOLO v2 (You Only Look Once) model architecture from scratch for object detection in images.
### The model consists of 19 convolutional layers and 5 max-pooling layers throughout the architecture.
### The convolutional layers are responsible for feature extraction from the input image. Max-pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps and reduce the spatial dimensions.
