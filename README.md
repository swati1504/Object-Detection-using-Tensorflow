# Object-Detection-using-Tensorflow

### Built an object detection model using tensorflow to detect objects in images from the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset.
### I chose to implement the YOLO v2 (You Only Look Once) model architecture from scratch for object detection in images.
### The model consists of 19 convolutional layers and 5 max-pooling layers throughout the architecture.
### The convolutional layers are responsible for feature extraction from the input image. Max-pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps and reduce the spatial dimensions.
#### Please refer to the pdf provided.

### API python file is for the task to generate a coherent 5-sentence product description based on a given input using OpenAI API. The python script interacts with the API and prints the generated description.
